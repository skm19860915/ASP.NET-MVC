        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">We have found the following list of insurance companies may provide insurance from your auto policy during your rental period simply by asking their agents. When renting from ShareMyCoach we suggest contacting your insurance agent and ask that they provide temporary coverage’s. This is sometimes called a “binder” or “certificate”. Some agents may not know if they can provide such coverage and in this case contact our rental office for assistance.  If your insurance will not provide such coverage we may be able to provide "secondary coverage"</span>
