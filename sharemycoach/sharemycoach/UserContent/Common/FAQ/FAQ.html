        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">All of us at ShareMyCoach are excited to share our privately-owned fleet of vehicles available for our rental program with you. Please take the time to look over our Frequently Asked Questions area. We are adding and updating it on a regular basis. The questions and answers are here to help assist you in the rental process and during your trip.</span><br /><br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">For the most part the goal of SMC is to provide a one price does it all approach to renting an RV from us. Some items may be added but as you will see we include a generous number of free miles and when a generator is built-in the vehicle we also in 4 free hours per rental day. Our vehicles come with housewares and all items needed to operate the vehicle.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">How many Miles are included with the daily rental price?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">100 free miles are included with all gas engine models, and 150 miles with diesel engines. Extra mileage cost between $0.35 - $1.00 per mile depending on days rented and miles driven.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">If I want to bring my pet or dog, what do I need to do?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">Most of our vehicles do not allow pets so please ask. If your vehicle does then a deposit per owners approval of $50 will be required.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">What is a Sprinter style of an RV?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">It's a Mercedes chassis with a diesel engine that gets around 16 miles per gallon. Used in a variety of sizes between 20-24' feet and comes in a B class version (camper van) also known as  a B+ or small C class with the cab over bunk and a variety of different floor plans.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Why do you charge by the day and not the night?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">That way you get the full use of each day because you can pick up as early as 9 am or when your location opens in the morning on your pick-up day and return the vehicle as late as when your location closes on the return day. Nightly rentals won't allow you to pick up before mid-afternoon and you must return before around 10 am or they charge you more causing what we call “timing stress”. Remember you are on vacation or business and you have enough to think about already.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Do you have minimum day rentals?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">Yes. Starting Mid May just before Memorial Day until September 15th we have a 4-day minimum on C class and 5 days on A class. Always be sure to ask for vehicles that may be on a special per the owners.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Why do you charge a cleaning and preparation charge?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">This will provide you as the renter the best chance for the cleanest RV you have ever used and provides you with a professionally clean spotless RV. We have had issues with previous renters cleaning the RV and it has not been up to our high standards.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">What happens if I have a breakdown on a rental?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">First you will want to call us on the number you were given prior to your departure. Our tech support knows and understands your RV. For the clear majority we can solve the issue by phone. In most cases this is all it takes as it is a button or fuse that needs to be pushed or reset. If that does not work, we will send a roadside RV Tech to handle the problem while out on the rental.</span>
