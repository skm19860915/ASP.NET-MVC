        <span style="color:black;">How many Miles are included with the daily rental price?</span>
        <br />

        <span style="color:black;">What is a Sprinter?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">It's a Mercedes chassis with a diesel engine that gets 16-21 miles per gallon. Used in a variety of sizes between 20-24' feet and comes in a B class version(camper van), a B+ or small C class with the cab over bunk and a variety of different floor plans.</span>

        <span style="color:black;">Where are some local campgrounds I can visit?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">
            Here is the website for Sonoma County campgrounds.

        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Why do you charge by the day and not the night?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">That way you get the full use of each day because you can pick up as early as 9am on your pick up day and return the vehicle as late as 6pm on the return day. Nightly rentals won't allow you to pick up before mid-afternoon and you must return before 11am or they charge you up to $50 and hour if you are late.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Do you have minimum day rentals?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">Yes. Starting May 15th until September 15th we have a 4 day minimum on C class and 5 day on A class.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black;">Why do you charge a cleaning and preparation charge?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="color:black; font-weight:normal;">This will provide you as the renter the cleanest RV you have ever used and provides you with a professionally clean spotless RV. We have had issues with previous renters cleaning the RV and it has not been up to our high standards. The preparation charge includes testing all systems, doing a full safety check on the RV and includes up to an hour or more of orientation on how to use the RV. We can even take you for a test ride to get comfortable driving the vehicle before you leave on your own. We are also always available by phone to provide tech support and to answer any questions or issues while on a rental.</span>

        <span style="color:black;">What happens if I have a breakdown on a rental?</span>
