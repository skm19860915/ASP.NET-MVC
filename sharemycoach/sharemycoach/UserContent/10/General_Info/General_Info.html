        1.	All ShareMyCoach Franchise locations offer privately owned rentals based on a per day rental. Minimum rental periods vary from 3 to 7 days. Minimum rental period during holidays and special events are often longer. Pickups and returns at some locations are by appointment, but most locations are flexible. All rentals originate at a franchise location and must be returned to that location unless arrangements are made in advance. Rates are subject to change without notice so always confirm. No sales tax is required on privately owned rental vehicles as the sales tax for the coach was paid at the time of purchase by the owners.

        2.	Included mileage is from 100 to 150 miles per rental day and included in the rental price. Excess miles traveled range from $.35 to $1.20 per mile.
        <br><br>
        3.	All ShareMyCoach Franchise locations will provide you with a rental agreement and insurance binder request form to be given to your insurance company so that they may provide a policy binder covering the RV rental period. For a list of insurance companies that will provide you a binder ask your agent. The completed insurance binder must be returned to our office a
        minimum of 2 days prior to departure. The least expensive way to insure your rental vehicle is
        through your insurance company as it usually is free or almost free. If your insurance policy
        does not allow this kind of an RV rental binder, then contact us regarding a possible secondary commercial insurance policy. Renters will be responsible to pay a damage deposit equal to the insurance deductible on any policy used to cover the rental period. Usually from $1000 to $5000. Upon the successful completion of the rental period if no damages occurred the deposit will be returned. Renter is responsible for ALL damages. Secondary insurance if available is only for state minimum coverage. <br>
