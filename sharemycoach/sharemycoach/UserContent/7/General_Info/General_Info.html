        <p>ShareMyCoachSonoma.com (SMCS) offers privately owned rentals based on a per day rental, we are located in Novato 35 mins north of San Francisco. Minimum rental periods vary from 3 to 7 days. Minimum rental period during holidays and special events are 5 days. We rent by the day not the night so you can get the full use of each day. &nbsp;Pickups and returns are by appointment, but we're flexible. All rentals originate at our Marin&nbsp;County location unless other arrangements have been made in advance. We also service Sonoma and Napa County's and can arrange delivery and pick up. Rates are subject to change without notice. No sales tax required as all coaches are privately owned and the sales tax for the coach was paid at the time of purchase by the owners. &nbsp;</p>
        <li>100&nbsp;free miles per rental day are included in the rental price. Excess miles range from $.45 to $1.20 per mile depending on vehicle class and days rented.

        <li>Insurance: ShareMyCoachSonoma Privately Owned RV Rentals will provide you with a rental agreement. This agreement should be given to your insurance company in order to establish a policy binder covering the RV rental period. The completed insurance binder must be returned to our office a minimum of 2 days prior to departure. The least expensive way to insure your rental vehicle is through your insurance company. Renters will be responsible to pay a damage deposit equal to the insurance deductible on any policy used to cover the rental period. Upon the successful completion of the rental period if no damages occurred the deposit will be returned. Renter is responsible for ALL damages. Commercial Insurance is only for Vehicle Collision as it does not cover any other damages! &nbsp; <br><br></li>
